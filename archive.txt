🚀 New project Completed ─ CineWave (React + TMDB API)

I've just finished CineWave, a movie discovery web app built with React and The Movie Database (TMDB) API.



This project was inspired by a tutorial from Shubham Sarda, which helped me strengthen my understanding of React architecture, routing, and API integration.



🔧 On top of the base project, I implemented several improvements:



• Real-time search using onChange

• Search optimization with debounce to limit API calls

• Loader and user feedback during API requests

• Prevention of empty search queries

• Safer search handling using trim() and encodeURIComponent


🎯 Key features:


• Browse popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies

• Detailed movie pages (overview, genres, ratings, runtime, budget, revenue, IMDb link)

• Dark / light mode with persistence

• Smooth navigation with React Router



This project helped me move beyond just following a tutorial and focus on code quality, UX, and performance.

Here's the live version : https://cinewave-ft.netlify.app/
